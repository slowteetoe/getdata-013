# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Data source: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## About these files
```CodeBook.md``` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
```run_analysis.R``` downloads the dataset, processes the dataset, transforms it into a tidy dataset, and writes the tidy data to a file in the current directory called ```tidydata.txt```.  (NOTE: due to size, the UCI dataset is NOT included in this git repository.  It will be downloaded and unzipped by the script upon demand)
