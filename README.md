The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

### For each record it is provided:
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
- Its activity label.
- An 86-feature vector with the mean of the mean and std for time and frequency domain variables. 


## About these files
```CodeBook.md``` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data

```run_analysis.R```

*  downloads the dataset
*  processes the original dataset by merging the train and test datasets, adding column labels
*  transforms it into a tidy dataset, aggregating the mean of the columns by subject id and activity name
*  writes the tidy data to a file in the current directory called ```tidydata.txt```

(NOTE: due to size, the UCI dataset is NOT included in this git repository.  It will be downloaded and unzipped by the script upon demand)
